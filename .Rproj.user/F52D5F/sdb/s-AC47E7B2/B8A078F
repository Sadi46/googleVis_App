The custom function `peak()` does that automatically (in case of `unknown/url` data, it reads only 30 rows to help decide if and how to download the complete dataset). </small> \n \n\n\n\nUsing and Changing\n========================================================\n\n<br></br>\nThis is a beginners project under development. \nMost of the code was built by many others \n(as R is developed on the shoulders of thousands) and adapted to my needs.\n\nI would like to appreciate the expertise of some giants though:  \nhttps://github.com/hadley   \nhttps://github.com/jcheng5\n\nThis application may not contain the best possible code and is unfinished,\nso feel free to use and change it to your needs.\nI have tried to include resources within the code files where ever I used custom functions from other people. \nMost resources can be used according to terms under the [Apache License, Version 2.](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0),\nor according to terms described in the [creative commons Attribution 3.0 License](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/).\nGoogleVis portions are created by \"Google\" and shared under terms described [here](https://developers.google.com/terms/)\n    \n<small>See https://www.coursera.org/learn/data-products and the links in the application for more info on developing data products</small> \n\n",
